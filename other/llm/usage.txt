how can i make a regression on y = win rate and x = being at home, goals scored and shots on target from the dataset i have?

ChatGPT

To run a regression with 'Win Rate' as your dependent variable (y) and 'Being at Home', 'Goals Scored', and 'Shots on Target' as independent variables (x), you will first need to restructure your data into a format suitable for regression analysis. In a typical regression model, you need to have observations for each match that include both the home and away data.

The "Being at Home" variable should be a binary indicator where 1 indicates the team was playing at home and 0 indicates they were playing away. Since you want to run the regression on match-level data, you'll need to have a single observation per match, which means combining your home and away team data into one row per match.

However, based on the data you provided and the existing analysis_data dataframe, you would first need to convert the team-wise statistics back to match-level observations before you can proceed with regression.

Here's a simplified example of how to prepare your data and run a linear regression using R:

# Assuming your analysis_data is in match-level format and includes the Win column for home wins (1 = home win, 0 = not home win)
# You'll need to create a new column for 'Being at Home' (1 for home team, 0 for away team)
# and another column 'Away_Win' to indicate away wins (1 = away win, 0 = not away win)
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(Being_at_Home = if_else(`Full Time Result` == 'H', 1, 0),
         Away_Win = if_else(`Full Time Result` == 'A', 1, 0))

# To perform the regression, you would need to create a new dataframe that includes both home and away statistics for each match
# One way to do this is to "gather" the data into a long format and then "spread" it back to wide while differentiating home and away
match_data <- analysis_data %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "value", `Full Time Home Team Goals`:`Away Team Shots on Target`) %>%
  separate(variable, into = c("location", "stat"), sep = " ") %>%
  spread(key = location, value = value) %>%
  unite(Team, `Home Team`, `Away Team`, remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(Win_Rate = if_else(`Full Time Result` == 'H', Home, Away_Win)) %>%
  select(Team, Being_at_Home, Win_Rate, `Home Team Goals`, `Home Team Shots on Target`, `Away Team Goals`, `Away Team Shots on Target`)

# Now, assume we have match_data in the correct format, you could run a regression as follows
regression_model <- lm(Win_Rate ~ Being_at_Home + `Home Team Goals` + `Home Team Shots on Target`, data = match_data)

# Output the summary of the regression model
summary(regression_model)

why use stan glm

ChatGPT
Using stan_glm from the rstanarm package in R is chosen for several reasons, especially when you need Bayesian inference for generalized linear models (GLMs). Here are some of the advantages and use-cases for stan_glm:

Bayesian Framework: stan_glm allows you to fit GLMs within a Bayesian framework, which can provide a richer understanding of the parameter estimates by accounting for prior information and returning full posterior distributions instead of point estimates.

Uncertainty Estimation: Bayesian models naturally provide estimates of uncertainty in the form of credible intervals for the model parameters, which can be more informative than frequentist confidence intervals.

Handling Complex Models: stan_glm is particularly useful when dealing with complex models or when the dataset is not large enough for traditional methods to provide stable estimates.

Incorporating Prior Knowledge: With Bayesian methods, you can incorporate prior knowledge or expert opinion into the analysis, which can be particularly useful when data are sparse or when you want to include information from previous studies.

Robustness: Bayesian models can be more robust to violations of the usual assumptions of GLMs, such as normality of residuals or homoscedasticity.

Model Checking and Improvement: stan_glm provides tools for model checking, such as posterior predictive checks, which can help validate the model fit. If the model doesnâ€™t fit well, you can easily extend it or improve it using the rich Stan modeling language.

Predictive Performance: Bayesian models often have better predictive performance, especially in systems that are well understood where strong priors can be specified.

Flexibility in Inference: With the full posterior distributions, you can easily compute the posterior predictions, expected losses, or make decisions based on the entire distribution of the parameters, not just point estimates.

In summary, you would use stan_glm when you are interested in the benefits of Bayesian statistics, and you need a tool that is flexible, powerful, and provides a complete probabilistic approach to regression analysis. It's particularly beneficial when you have complex models, prior information to incorporate, or when traditional GLM assumptions may not hold.

legends are too big

ChatGPT

If the legend is too big and dominating the plot, you can make a few adjustments to reduce its size and make your plot cleaner. Here's how you can modify the legend in your ggplot:

Reduce text size: You can decrease the size of the legend text.
Change the number of columns: You can increase the number of columns to make the legend wider and less tall.
Overriding aesthetics: You might be able to reduce the size of the points in the legend.
Adjusting the margin: You can adjust the margins around the legend to make it more compact.
Here's how you can implement these changes:

library(ggplot2)

# Assuming team_level_data_goals and colors are already defined
ggplot(team_level_data_goals, aes(x = Avg_Shots_on_Target, y = Win_Rate, color = `Team`)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = setNames(colors, team_level_data_goals$`Team`)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "The Relationship Between Shots on Target and Win Rate",
    x = "Average Shots on Target",
    y = "Win Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.title = element_blank(),  # Remove legend title if desired
    legend.position = "right",  # Adjust legend position if needed
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  # Reduce text size
    legend.key.size = unit(0.5, 'cm'),  # Reduce key size
    legend.margin = margin(2, 2, 2, 2)  # Reduce margin around legend
  ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 2))  # Increase the number of columns if needed

ggsave("plot.pdf", width = 10, height = 8)  # Save the plot with appropriate dimensions
Make sure to adjust the ncol parameter in guides() according to the number of teams you have. Increasing the number of columns might help to make the legend more horizontally spread out, reducing its overall size.

Additionally, by saving the plot using ggsave() with specified width and height, you can control the overall size of the plot and, indirectly, the size of the legend. Adjust these parameters as needed for your specific display or document requirements.
